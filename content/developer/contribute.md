# Contributing to geteduroam

We use GitHub for development under the [geteduroam organization](https://github.com/geteduroam).

You can create issues on the projects there if you find any bugs, or send pull requests.

We also have a channel #geteduroam on the [eduroam Slack](https://eduroam.slack.com).
